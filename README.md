a simple drum machine inspired by the akai mpc 2000xl with of course very limited functionality

only hiphop mode is implemented because im to lazy to search for royalty free sounds

pressing the 3x3 key area starting with q w e and ending with y x c also triggers the drum pads (but make sure the drum machine is actually turned on hehe)
